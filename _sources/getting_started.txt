Installing the module
=====================

You may already have `datatank_py <https://github.com/amaxwell/datatank_py>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import datatank_py'

If that fails grab the latest version from GitHub with::

  > git clone https://github.com/amaxwell/datatank_py.git
  > cd datatank_py
  > sudo python setup.py install
  
.. _file_read_example:

Example: Reading a DataTank file
================================

Create a data file in DataTank called ``example.dtbin``, 
and read the variables using :class:`datatank_py.DTDataFile.DTDataFile`.

.. image:: _static/datafile_example_ss.png

>>> from datatank_py.DTDataFile import DTDataFile
>>> dtf = DTDataFile("example.dtbin")
>>> for name in dtf:
...   print "%s = %s" % (name, dtf[name])
...

Key points from this exercise:

#. Variable structure is complicated, but is documented in DataTank's manual
   (see the menu "Help -> Manual -> DataTank Manual (pdf)" in DataTank)
#. Some arrays have one or more empty dimensions, and may need to be flattened
#. Strings are ``unicode`` objects in Python

At this point, you can manipulate or modify the variables, and can
even append to the file. *However, you cannot rewrite existing variables
in a file!*

Example: Manipulating a 2D mesh
===============================

.. _mesh_example:

In this example, we create a 2D mesh in DataTank and multiply it
by a scalar value using Python. This is contrived, as it's obviously
easier to do this within DataTank itself! However, the code shown here
is the basic skeleton of any DataTank module that you'll create using
Python.

.. image:: _static/mesh_example_ss.png

.. sourcecode:: python

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    # coding: utf-8

    from datatank_py.DTDataFile import DTDataFile
    from datatank_py.DTMesh2D import DTMesh2D

    # import all functions from DTError
    from datatank_py.DTError import *

    from time import time
    import sys

    def computation(mesh, scalar):
    
        # here we get the value array from the DTMesh2D object
        values = mesh.values()
    
        # just multiply all values by the constant
        values *= scalar
    
        # return a new mesh object, reusing the same grid with our new values
        return DTMesh2D(values, grid=mesh.grid())

    if __name__ == '__main__':
    
        with DTDataFile("Input.dtbin") as input_file:
        
            # This is the highest level way to get an object, but isn't a complete
            # feature for all classes yet. Alternate way to get it would be
            # mesh = DTMesh2D.from_data_file(input_file, "input"), which is
            # slightly more verbose and requires you to import DTMesh2D.
            mesh = input_file.dt_object_named("input")
        
            # This uses Python's dictionary getter syntax to get a primitive object
            # that isn't wrapped in a DT class. This is the most convenient way to
            # get an array, number, string, or list of strings. The name "scalar"
            # comes from DataTank, and can include any Unicode characters.
            scalar = input_file["scalar"]
        
            start_time = time()
        
            # This is just an example; another possibility is wrapping the entire
            # main call in an exception handler.
            try:
                output_mesh = computation(mesh, scalar)
            except Exception, e:
                DTErrorMessage("my_example.py", "Exception raised: %s" % (e))
                   
            # create or truncate the output file    
            with DTDataFile("Output.dtbin", truncate=True) as output_file:
            
                # record computation time
                output_file["ExecutionTime"] = (time() - start_time)
        
                # save errors (if any)
                DTSaveError(output_file)
            
                # Save the output variable; DataTank expects returned variables
                # to be named "Var".
                output_file["Var"] = output_mesh
            
If you've ever written a C++ program for DataTank using the Xcode
skeleton it creates, the preceding code should look familiar.
However, ``datatank_py`` implements and uses Python idioms wherever
possible, as a straight C++ translation is undesirable for most Python
programmers (as well as downright unreadable).
