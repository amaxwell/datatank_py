=============
WHAT IS THIS?
=============

This is a Python module that allows you to read and write DataTank data files using
Python. `DataTank <http://visualdatatools.com/DataTank/>`_ is a visualization and 
analysis tool for Mac OS X. Although DataTank itself is proprietary (now free of
charge for students and postdocs), it includes open-source C++ libraries for most
of the internal data structures, so you can easily create data files to be loaded
into it.

--------------------
When would I use it?
--------------------

* You're using DataTank for analysis, and need a quickie module (external program) 
  to transform some data. You could use the excellent C++ libraries, but sometimes 
  Xcode is more trouble than it's worth, especially since Apple turned it into iTunes for code.
* You're already running numerical experiments in Python using numpy/scipy, and 
  want to easily view the results in DataTank.
* Sometimes data isn't wrapped up nicely in a netCDF file, or you want to 
  create a smaller subset of a large dataset to analyze in DataTank.
* You have an HDF-5 file, and need to use PyTables to extract the relevant parts.
* You have some gruesome ASCII data format that a colleague invented while drunk, 
  and you need to parse it with Python because it has better string APIs than 
  certain popular commercial analysis packages.

I use it to incorporate GIS data with 3D hydrodynamic model output for coastal flow
and transport simulations. Being able to reproject images to/from Lat/Lon or Cartesian
coordinates using GDAL is a great asset. See the examples for ideas on how to do
some of this.

-------------------------
When should I not use it?
-------------------------

* Not all DataTank objects are fully supported in `datatank_py`, unlike the 
  C++ DTSource libraries (but they are usually easy to add).
* The C++ libraries are highly optimized, and can be significantly 
  faster than using Python.
* You need to use other libraries (C/C++/FORTRAN/etc), and equivalent 
  functions are not available in Python.

=======
INSTALL
=======

The module can be installed using as usual, using::

  sudo pip install datatank_py

or::
    
  sudo easy_install datatank_py
    
in a terminal. 

If you're modifying `datatank_py` and want Python to see the development
copy, you can use::

  python setup.py develop
    
in your source directory to set up the path appropriately.

Some of the test scripts assume that various symlinks exist in datatank_py/examples.
This is mainly so I can test on multiple systems without hardcoding absolute paths.

============
REQUIREMENTS
============

----------------
Operating System
----------------

DTDataFile has been tested with Python 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 on Mac OS X 10.5-10.9, and
Python 2.5 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (64 bit).  Some of the examples may
require Python 2.6 at minimum, or inclusion of::

  from __future__ import with_statement

before any other import statements for Python 2.5. It should still work with PowerPC,
but that hasn't been tested in years, and you're on your own.

-----
NumPy
-----

NumPy is a requirement, and I have no interest in working with Numeric or Numarray.
You can download `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ or make do with Apple's lobotomized
and ancient version as shipped with OS X.  If you do compile your own, I've found it
necessary to get rid of the OS-installed version, particularly since SciPy won't
compile with it installed.  To do this, I use the following Terminal commands on
Mac OS X 10.6. For later versions, you may not need to do this::

  cd /System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.6/Extras/lib/python
  sudo tar -czf numpy.apple.tgz numpy
  rm -r numpy

This leaves you a backup of the system-installed NumPy, in case you ever want it.
You can also do this by adjusting paths in /Library/Python, which is probably a
better way.

----
GDAL
----

Some of the examples require `GDAL <http://www.gdal.org/>`_ with Python bindings. 
I find this invaluable for getting geospatial data into DataTank, even though 
the SWIG bindings seem like writing C++ using Python syntax.

PIL
---

Some of the examples require `PIL <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, 
the Python Imaging Library. If you don't have PIL installed, you should.

=============
DOCUMENTATION
=============

Online help and examples: `<http://amaxwell.github.io/datatank_py/>`_

DTDataFile is extensively documented in the source, so `help(DTDataFile)` in an
interpreter should get you started.  There are a bunch of private methods and
functions that won't show up in pydoc, but they are documented so I don't forget
what they're supposed to do.

BUGS
====

Please email me at amaxwell AT mac DOT com with suggestions for improvement,
or use the tracker at GitHub. For bug fixes, feel free to send a pull request,
and I'll try and figure out how to use git enough to merge it in.
