Installing your doc directory
=============================

You may already have `datatank_py <https://github.com/amaxwell/datatank_py>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import datatank_py'

If that fails grab the latest version from GitHub with::

  > git clone https://github.com/amaxwell/datatank_py.git
  > cd datatank_py
  > sudo python setup.py install
