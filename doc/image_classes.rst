Prerequisites
=============

To gain any more functionality beyond simple read/write of DataTank images,
you will need to install one or more of these modules.

GDAL
----

You may already have `GDAL <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GDAL/>`_
and its Python bindings installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import gdal'

For a binary install of GDAL, see 
`this page <http://trac.osgeo.org/gdal/wiki/DownloadingGdalBinaries>`_
which has links for various platforms. The Mac OS X framework package
includes Python bindings.

PIL
---

The `Python Imaging Library <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PIL>`_ 
is also required for some operations, and
is generally a useful thing to have. You can check for it with::

  python -c 'import Image'

If it's not installed, you can try::

  sudo easy_install PIL
  
This may or may not give you a useful module, depending on what
shared libraries you have available. Refer to the PIL documentation
for more details.

Geospatial image example
========================

.. image:: _static/ss_image_as_bitmap.png

This example shows different ways of passing a file to an external program.
In one case, we pass a DataTank "File" object, which results in a hard link
named "Image File" in the Python program's working directory. This is most
efficient in terms of disk space, but sometimes a geospatial raster includes
a so-called "world file" which provides coordinate information, rather than
embedding it in the TIFF tags.
For example, "my_geotiff.tiff" could have a corresponding "my_geotiff.tfw"
and GDAL knows to look for that file alongside the GeoTIFF. In that case,
you need to pass the absolute path.

Clear as mud? Use The Source, Luke! Hopefully this example will clarify
the words above.
